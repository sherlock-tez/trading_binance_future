## Strategy Summary

This bot opens BTCUSDC 1h positions on strict confluence:

1. RSI divergence (mandatory)
2. MACD divergence (mandatory unless `require_macd_divergence: false`)
3. RSI extremity gate (LONG only if RSI < `rsi_long_max`; SHORT only if RSI > `rsi_short_min`)
4. Trend filter on signal timeframe (LONG only above EMA, SHORT only below EMA) when `use_trend_filter: true`
5. Multi-timeframe support/resistance context (entry between nearest support and resistance)

A trade is valid only when all required conditions agree on the same direction.

## Indicators

### RSI Divergence

- Compute RSI on 1h close prices.
- Identify swing pivots using `pivot_window`.
- Bullish divergence: price lower low, RSI higher low. Additionally requires `RSI < rsi_long_max` at the signal candle.
- Bearish divergence: price higher high, RSI lower high. Additionally requires `RSI > rsi_short_min` at the signal candle.

The user-required rule "LONG only if RSI < 50, SHORT only if RSI > 50" is always enforced via `rsi_long_max <= 50` and `rsi_short_min >= 50`. Tightening (e.g., `rsi_short_min = 60`) is permitted because a stricter gate still satisfies the rule.

### MACD Divergence

- Compute MACD line, signal line, and histogram on 1h close prices.
- Use MACD line for divergence against price pivots.
- Bullish divergence: price lower low, MACD higher low.
- Bearish divergence: price higher high, MACD lower high.

### ATR (Average True Range)

- Wilder-style smoothed True Range on 1h with period `atr_period`.
- Used for volatility-aware stop loss / take profit sizing.

### Trend EMA (optional gate)

- EMA on 1h close with period `trend_ema_period`.
- LONG entries require `last_close > ema`; SHORT entries require `last_close < ema`.
- Enabled by `use_trend_filter: true`.

## Support / Resistance

- Build levels from timeframes: 3h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 1w.
- Each timeframe contributes pivot highs (resistance) and pivot lows (support).
- Levels are merged by proximity to remove duplicates.
- Binance Futures does not provide a native 3h kline endpoint, so 3h candles are resampled from 1h data.
- Levels gate entry direction (LONG requires `support < last_price < resistance` and vice versa).
- When `use_atr_stops: false`, levels also determine SL/TP placement (legacy mode).

## Entry and Direction

### Long

- RSI bullish divergence true
- MACD bullish divergence true (if required)
- `RSI < rsi_long_max` (must be <= 50)
- Trend filter passes (price above EMA when enabled)
- Current price between nearest support and nearest resistance

### Short

- RSI bearish divergence true
- MACD bearish divergence true (if required)
- `RSI > rsi_short_min` (must be >= 50)
- Trend filter passes (price below EMA when enabled)
- Current price between nearest support and nearest resistance

## Stop Loss / Take Profit Rules

### ATR-Based Stops (preferred mode, `use_atr_stops: true`)

- LONG: SL = entry - `atr_sl_mult` * ATR, TP = entry + `atr_tp_mult` * ATR.
- SHORT: SL = entry + `atr_sl_mult` * ATR, TP = entry - `atr_tp_mult` * ATR.
- Caps catastrophic loss and enforces a fixed reward/risk ratio = `atr_tp_mult / atr_sl_mult`.

### Support/Resistance Stops (legacy mode, `use_atr_stops: false`)

- LONG: SL slightly below nearest support, TP slightly below nearest resistance.
- SHORT: SL slightly above nearest resistance, TP slightly above nearest support.
- Buffers controlled by `stop_loss_buffer_bps` and `take_profit_buffer_bps`.

### Sanity gates (applied to both modes)

- LONG: requires `sl < entry < tp`; SHORT: requires `tp < entry < sl`.
- `min_rr_ratio`: if > 0, reject plans whose reward/risk is below the threshold.
- `max_sl_distance_pct`: if > 0, reject plans whose SL distance from entry exceeds the threshold (skip when volatility is unusually large).

## Position Sizing

- Position notional = `position_equity_ratio` * equity * `leverage`.
- Default: `leverage=10`, `position_equity_ratio=0.95`.
- Portfolio max open positions = `max_open_positions` (default 1).

## Execution Constraints

- Maker-only required.
- Orders must be post-only.
- If an order would execute immediately, cancel and reprice.

## Backtest Logic

- Backtest reuses production strategy functions for signal generation (`SignalEngine.generate_signal`).
- Single shared `run_trade_cycle` orchestration is invoked by both live and backtest runners.
- Simulated execution models maker fees and post-only behavior.
- Required month windows: 1, 3, 6, 12, 15.
- Runtime loop behavior:
  - Iterate timeline by 1h candles.
  - Update open position with each bar for SL/TP check.
  - Position-limit rejection is enforced by execution adapters with the same rejection reason.

A separate fast vectorized harness (`scripts/btcusdc_fast.py`) is used for parameter search. It is mathematically equivalent to the engine path (parity verified against `scripts/btcusdc_optimize.py`) and only serves the iterative tuning loop; production logic still flows through `SignalEngine` + `run_trade_cycle` + `SimulatedExecutionAdapter`.

## Known Limitations

- Divergence quality depends on pivot identification sensitivity.
- Support/resistance clustering can underfit or overfit volatile regimes.
- Funding, ADL, and liquidation engine effects are simplified in simulation.
- Fast-path harness uses pivots computed on the full base series; for nearly all bars this matches the engine's tail-restricted pivots, but boundary-case pivots near the left edge of a tail may differ by 1-2 trades over a 15-month window (verified against production engine for the final config).
